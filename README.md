# 📌 myCalculator
*A simple command-line calculator for basic arithmetic operations.*

## 📖 Project Overview
**Author:** Noumana Haq  
**Date:** 07/02/2025  
**Version:** 1.0  

**myCalculator** is a basic calculator application designed for general users to perform simple arithmetic operations such as **addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division**. This application runs in a **command-line interface (CLI)** and ensures reliability and ease of use. Future enhancements may include a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** and additional features.

## 🚀 Features
✔ Perform basic arithmetic operations: **+, -, *, /**  
✔ Handles invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric values)  
✔ Displays error messages for incorrect operations (e.g., division by zero)  
✔ Allows continuous calculations without restarting

## 🔄 User Flow
1️⃣ User starts the program.  
2️⃣ System prompts for the first number.  
3️⃣ System asks for an operation (+, -, *, /).  
4️⃣ System prompts for the second number.  
5️⃣ System displays the result.  
6️⃣ User can choose to continue or exit.
